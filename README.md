Quotes: A Collection of HTML Quote Documents
This repository serves as a centralized and easily accessible collection of HTML-formatted quote documents. The project is designed to be deployed using Cloudflare Pages, providing a simple, fast, and organized way to view all your quotes online.

Key Features
Organized Structure: Quotes are categorized into a clean, hierarchical folder structure (e.g., by month or project).

Web Accessibility: The collection is deployed as a static website, allowing you to view and share quotes from anywhere.

Version Control: Hosted on GitHub, every change and update to a quote document is automatically tracked and managed.

Automated Deployment: Integration with Cloudflare Pages ensures that any new quotes or updates pushed to this repository are automatically published.
